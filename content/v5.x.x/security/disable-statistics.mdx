# Disable Statistics

You can disable system statistics by using setting `false` in ESPDash class constructor as the last parameter.

If you would like to completely disable and hide the statistics tab from the sidebar, please use the below code and make sure you don't have any <i>custom statistics</i>. By doing so, it will automatically hide the "statistics" tab from sidebar.

**If no custom URI is defined (second parameter):**
```cpp
ESPDash dashboard(&server, false);
```

**If using custom URI (third parameter):**
```cpp
ESPDash dashbord(&server, "/", false);
```
