# Commercial License

ESP-DASH Lite (open-source version) and ESP-DASH Pro are two different versions of the same realtime dashboard library, each with its own set of features and licensing terms. Here's a comparison between ESP-DASH Lite, which is open-source and GPL-3.0 based, and ESP-DASH Pro:

1. Licensing:
   - ESP-DASH Lite: This version is open-source and released under the GPL-3.0 license. It means that it's freely available for anyone to use, modify, and distribute. However, if you use ESP-DASH Lite in a commercial product, the GPL-3.0 license requires you to make the source code of your product, including any modifications to ESP-DASH Lite, available to the public.

   - ESP-DASH Pro: This version is offered under a one-time charge for a commercial license. It allows you to use ESP-DASH Pro in a commercial product without the requirement to open-source your proprietary code. The commercial license provides more flexibility and protection for businesses.

2. Support:
   - ESP-DASH Lite: Support for ESP-DASH Lite is typically community-driven. You may find help through online forums, documentation, or user-contributed resources. However, professional support may be limited.

   - ESP-DASH Pro: ESP-DASH Pro includes dedicated support and assistance. This can be essential for businesses that require timely and reliable support to ensure their application runs smoothly.

In summary, the choice between ESP-DASH Lite and ESP-DASH Pro depends on your specific needs and the nature of your project:

- If you are working on an open-source project or have no concerns about the GPL-3.0 license's requirements and need basic dashboard functionality, ESP-DASH Lite is a viable choice.

- If you are developing a commercial product, ESP-DASH Pro provides a more comprehensive and professionally supported solution while allowing you to maintain the proprietary nature of your code. However, it comes with a one-time commercial licensing fee.
