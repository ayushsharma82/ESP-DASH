Branding in this context refers to the logo that is displayed on the ESP-DASH dashboard. You can easily replace the logo by defining the logo image as a byte array in the `logo.h` and `logo.cpp` files of the library's source code without even touching HTML or CSS.

## Procedure

To add your custom logo on the ESP-DASH Pro dashboard, follow these steps:

<Steps>

### Prepare logo

First, you need to create or obtain the logo image you want to display on the dashboard. Ensure that the logo image is in a suitable format, such as a SVG (recommended) / PNG or JPG file and make sure your image is optimized & small in file size.

### Convert logo to a byte array

To include the logo in your library, you'll need to convert the image into a byte array.

1. Go to [File2Raw utility](https://file2raw.labrat.one/) ( I created this utility a few years back for the purpose of converting files into byte array for C++ applications ).
2. Select your logo.
3. Select "Gzip Compress" & "Use PROGMEM (Arduino)".
4. Click "Convert".

### Modify `logo.h`

1. Open the `logo.h` file in your ESP-DASH library source code.

2. Locate the `DASH_LOGO` byte array declaration, which should look like this:

   ```cpp
   extern const uint8_t DASH_LOGO[];
   ```

3. Replace the length of the `DASH_LOGO` array with your custom logo's byte array length.

4. Locate the `DASH_LOGO_MIME` variable, which defines the MIME type of your logo image. By default, it is set to `image/png`. If your logo is in a different format (e.g., JPEG), update the `DASH_LOGO_MIME` variable to the appropriate MIME type.

5. Set `DASH_LOGO_WIDTH` & `DASH_LOGO_HEIGHT` according to your desired size which will be displayed on the webpage.

### Modify `logo.cpp`

1. Open the `logo.cpp` file in your ESP-DASH Pro library source code.

2. Replace the contents of the `DASH_LOGO` array with your custom logo's byte array generated in File2Raw utility.


### Upload firmware

After making these changes, compile and upload the firmware with modified ESP-DASH Pro library to your device.

</Steps>

## Final Words

Once you have uploaded the modified ESP-DASH Pro library to your device, the custom logo will be displayed on your dashboard.
