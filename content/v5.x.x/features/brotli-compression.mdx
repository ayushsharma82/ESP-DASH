Inside ESP-DASH Pro, there is an option to enable Brotli compression to further reduce the size of webpage (dashboard) and provide you more space for your code. We've noticed around 40% more reduction in size over gzip compression (default).

Please note that Brotli compression is only supported by Safari browser with unencrpyted HTTP protocol. Due to constraints set by other browsers ( Chrome, Edge, Firefox etc. ) you need to use HTTPS for brotli compression to work properly.

***Broti compression is disabled by default.** It's up to user to enable brotli if the above conditions are fine for your use-case.*

#### How to enable

You can switch to brotli compression by setting `DASH_USE_BROTLI_COMPRESSION` to `1` in `edp.h`.

1. Open `edp.h` in src directory of ESP-DASH Pro library.
2. Locate `DASH_USE_BROTLI_COMPRESSION`
3. Set it to `1`
4. That's it. Save, compile and upload again to your microcontroller.
