Usually all widgets are placed in the order they are created. However, sometimes you may want to change the order of your cards or charts on the dashboard. ESP-DASH Pro provides you with a `setIndex` function in both cards and charts to modify the position of them on the dashboard. 

```cpp
card.setIndex(0); // Set your card index

// -- OR --

chart.setIndex(0); // Set your chart index
```

Indexing works in ascending format. The lowest card index will be placed in the front of the list and the highest index will be put in the end. It allows you to set the layout according to your wish.
