ESP-DASH has a dedicated page called "Statistics" on the dashboard which contain key-value pairs of system statistics ( heap, flash usage etc. ) by default. As of ESP-DASH v4, user defined statistics are now also part of the library! You can now add your own statitics to this page. ðŸŽ‰

<Callout>
  System statistics can be turned off any time, you may look at [Disable Statistics](./security/disable-statistics.md) page.
