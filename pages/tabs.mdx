"Tabs" in ESP-DASH Pro allow you to create multiple pages to organize and sort your various widgets (cards & charts). This feature comes particularly useful when there are all a lot of widgets.

By default, ESP-DASH puts everything into 'Overview' Tab.

<Callout>
  If every card or chart is assigned a custom tab, then the dashboard will intelligently hide the overview tab from sidebar.

## Example

### Create Tab
Initializer should be kept in global scope. ( ie. outside of any function in your sketch )

```cpp
Tab tab1(&dashboard, "Custom Tab 1");
```

### Set Tab
Once a tab has been created, you need to set the tab for relevant cards and charts using `setTab` function of Card or Chart class. `setTab` accepts a pointer to the tab which we just created.

```cpp
card1.setTab(&tab1);
```

```cpp
chart1.setTab(&tab1);
```
