# ESP-DASH v5

ESP-DASH v5 is a rewrite of ESP-DASH \*\*OSS and Pro## Motivation versions with C++ 17.

## Motivation

The rewrite has been motived by several factors including:

- the inherent design inefficient of memory usage: widgets are using about 2.5 more RAN memory than they really need
- websocket message optimisation: there are still room to allow more efficient message exchange between the client and the server
- inability to extend the components and behavior easily just by sub-classing
- inability to correctly handle a custom float precision
- inability to support all integral and floating point types
- no namespace isolation
- no STL string support
- pointer vs ref: the old API uses pointers to widgets, which is not idiomatic C++ and can lead to bugs if null is passed.

The rewrite uses **C++ 17 inheritance, polymorphism and templating**.

Here is a screenshot of before / after during the development.
Now, the `website.cpp` file is 15KB, compared to the initial 36KB.

**The preliminary results in a big app with about 225 cards and 30 stats show a decrease in RAM usage of about 60%.**

## Backward compatibility

~~The rewrite is also **backward compatible** and will display **deprecation compiler warnings** if the old deprecated API is used.~~
The rewrite is not backward compatible. The API changed significantly, so providing a backward compatibility layer is:

1. complicated and error-prone
2. requires to support it
3. will make the codebase more complex and harder to maintain

I am using v5 since months now, and I find it will be much easier to propose both v4 and v5 for download, tell people that v5 is the new version and that v4 won't be enhanced anymore.

## Benchmark.ino Example

[Benchmark.ino](./examples/Benchmark/Benchmark.ino) is a new example that demonstrates the new API and the new features.

## Compile flags

C++ 17 is required, which is the default in new Arduino versions, otherwise, you can add to your PIO file:

```
build_flags =
  -std=c++17
  -std=gnu++17
  -Wall -Wextra
  ; -D DASH_USE_LEGACY_CHART_STORAGE=1
  ; -D DASH_USE_STL_STRING=1
  ; -D DASH_DEBUG
build_unflags =
    -std=gnu++11
```

- `-D DASH_DEBUG`: activate debug mode
- `-D DASH_USE_STL_STRING=1`: uses `std::string` instead of `String` for the string type

ESP-DASH also defines its own string `dash::string`, which points to `String` or `std::string` depending on the flag `-D DASH_USE_STL_STRING=1`.
`dash::string` can be used to avoid using `String` or `std::string` directly and write portable code or examples.

## API Changes

### All Widgets

- Widgets generally support templated types: integral, floating point, string (`const char*`, `std::string`, `String`)
- Widgets generally support a custom precision for floating point types (default is 2)

Note: working with floating point numbers is generally slower than working with integral numbers because of the rounding step requiring to convert the number to a string representation with a fixed number of decimals.

### Statistics

- `dash::StatisticValue`: replaces `Statistic`
- `dash::StatisticProvider`: a new kind of auto-updatable statistic: the value is sourced from a function and is automatically updated when the dashboard is refreshed.

```cpp
// a string based statistic
dash::StatisticValue stat(dashboard, "Client name");

// a statistic string based using a constant string pointer
dash::StatisticValue<const char*> stat(dashboard, "State (on/off)");

// a float based statistic with a default precision of 2 decimals
dash::StatisticValue<float> stat(dashboard, "Temperature (°C)");

// a float based statistic with a custom precision of 3 decimals
dash::StatisticValue<float, 3> stat(dashboard, "Energy (kWh)");

// an integral based statistic
dash::StatisticValue<int8_t> stat(dashboard, "Percent (%)");

dash::StatisticProvider<uint32_t> statProvider(dashboard, "Uptime (ms)");
statProvider.setProvider([]() { return millis(); });
```

### Charts

Charts have 2 axis: X and Y.
For each axis, the type can be integral or floating point.
For the X axis, strings are also supported.

```cpp
dash::BarChart<const char*, int> bar(dashboard, "Power Usage (kWh) per day");

dash::BarChart<int, float> bar(dashboard, "Power Usage (kWh) per hour");
```

**For performance reasons, floating point precision is not supported for charts.**
It is advised to do the rounding in the value arrays.

### Cards

- `dash::FeedbackCard`

  - Replaces `STATUS_CARD`
  - Defaults to `dash::string` type
  - Supports also `const char*` with `dash::FeedbackCard<const char*>`
  - Supports an initial state

```cpp
dash::FeedbackCard<const char*> feedback(dashboard, "Status");
feedback.setFeedback("Light is ON", dash::Status::SUCCESS);
```

- `dash::GenericCard`
  - Replaces `GENERIC_CARD`
  - Defaults to `dash::string` type
  - Supports any integral, floating point type or string type
  - Supports a custom precision for floating point types
  - Supports a symbol or unit

```cpp
dash::GenericCard<int> generic(dashboard, "Counter", "restarts");
dash::GenericCard<float, 3> energy(dashboard, "Energy", "kWh");
dash::GenericCard<float, 4> kp(dashboard, "PID Kp");
```

- `dash::HumidityCard` and `dash::TemperatureCard`
  - Replaces `HUMIDITY_CARD` and `TEMPERATURE_CARD`
  - Defaults to `float` type with a precision of 2 decimals
  - Supports any integral or floating point type
  - Supports a custom precision for floating point types.
  - Unit is preset to `%` for humidity and `°C` for temperature but can be changed

```cpp
dash::TemperatureCard<float, 1> temperature(dashboard, "Temperature");
dash::TemperatureCard<float, 2> temperature(dashboard, "Temperature", "°F");
```

- `dash::ProgressCard`

  - Replaces `PROGRESS_CARD`
  - Defaults to `int` type
  - Supports any integral or floating point type
  - Supports a custom precision for floating point types.
  - Supports a symbol or unit
  - Allow a configurable min/max range

```cpp
dash::ProgressCard<float, 2> preciseProgress(dashboard, "Progress", 0.0f, 100.0f, "%");
```

- `dash::SliderCard`

  - Replaces`SLIDER_CARD`
  - Defaults to `int` type
  - Supports any integral or floating point type
  - Supports a custom precision for floating point types.
  - Supports a symbol or unit
  - Allow a configurable min/max range
  - Allow a configurable step

```cpp
dash::SliderCard duty(dashboard, "Duty", 0, 255, 1, "bits");
dash::SliderCard<float, 3> kp(dashboard, "PID Kp", 0.0f, 1.0f, 0.001f);
```

- `dash::SwitchCard`
  - Replaces `BUTTON_CARD`
  - Defaults to `bool` type

```cpp
dash::SwitchCard light(dashboard, "Light");
```

### Functions and callbacks

- `onChange([](<type>)){}`

Listen to card changes:

```cpp
button.onChange([&](bool state) {
  /* Print our new button value received from dashboard */
  Serial.println(String("Button Triggered: ") + (state ? "true" : "false"));
  /* Make sure we update our button's value and send update to dashboard */
  button.setValue(state);
  dashboard.refresh(button);
});

updateDelay.onChange([&](uint32_t value) {
  update_delay = value;
  updateDelay.setValue(value);
  dashboard.refresh(updateDelay);
});
```

- `value()`: get the value of a card
- `min()`, `max()`, `step()`: get the min, max, step of a slider card
- `setMin()`, `setMax()`, `setStep()`: set the min, max, step of a slider card
- `setFeedback()`: set the feedback of a feedback card
- `setValue()`: set the value of a card
- etc

## Optimisations

By default, the string type that will be used to store string values is `String` or `std::string` if the flag `-D DASH_USE_STL_STRING=1` is set.

To avoid allocating memory and copying strings, the `const char*` type can be used when the card is sourcing its content from constant strings only.

**Example:**

```cpp
dash::FeedbackCard<const char*> feedback(dashboard, "Status"); // uses c string pointers
dash::FeedbackCard customFeedback(dashboard, "Status");        // uses String or std::string object

// [...]

if(lightON)
  feedback.setFeedback("Light is ON", dash::Status::SUCCESS);
else
  feedback.setFeedback("Light is OFF", dash::Status::ERROR);

// [...]

customFeedback.setFeedback(dash::string("Counter: ") + count , dash::Status::WARNING);
```
