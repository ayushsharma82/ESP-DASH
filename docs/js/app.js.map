ESP-DASH V3.0 comes with reworked UI and Core routines ( Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/polaco1782\" target=\"_blank\">Cassiano Martin</a>! ). Performance has been improved again with the expertise of Cassiano handling the backend part and me handling the UI part.\r\n                                <br><br>\r\n                                The road doesn't stops here! Help us achieve more by supporting the project on <a href=\"#\" target=\"_blank\">OpenCollective</a>. There are still a lot of components ( charts, buttons, specific utilities etc. ) which are to be added in the library, and all of this requires time and funding.\r\n                                <br/><br/>\r\n                                The progress we have made, wouldn't had been possible without the support of our backers and contributors!. I'll continue developing ESP-DASH as it's the <b>love</b> from the community which drives any maker in this world to support his / her own creation 😉.\r\n                                <br/><br/>\r\n
